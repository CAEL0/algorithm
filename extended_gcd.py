In arithmetic and computer programming, the extended Euclidean algorithm is an extension to the Euclidean
algorithm, and computes, in addition to the greatest common divisor (gcd) of integers a and b, also the coefficients
of Bézout's identity, which are integers x and y such that ax + by = gcd(a, b).
